# shipping_project
This program is pretty simple. It takes inputs of the item, if it is fragile, the cost of the item, and the country it will be shipped to
it then outputs the item, the cost of shipping, the country being shipped to and the total cost. I added in Ukraine as the fourth country
However since ukraine is currently at war shipping cannot proceed and the program ends.
